Trials and tribulations of tackling Kaggle's RNA 3D Folding competition

## ðŸ§¬ About the Project

As a research scientist who studied miRNA and RNA-binding protein regulation of CD36's 3' UTR, I fully understand the complexity of RNA regulation studies. Due to the complex structure of mRNA, it's difficult to predict the interaction of regulatory factors. Being able to contribute to RNA structural findings on the dry side of science in a way that can potentially benefit the work of others is a huge passion of mine. This project documents my journey through Kaggleâ€™s RNA 3D Folding Prediction competition. Iâ€™ll be exploring different modeling approaches, tracking successes and failures, and implementing MLOps best practices to streamline my workflow.

## ðŸ“Š Competition Details

This project is based on Kaggle's RNA 3D Folding Prediction competition.  For full dataset details, visit the [**Kaggle competition page**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/your-competition-link).

## ðŸ§ª Experiment Tracking

All experiments and logs are tracked using MLflow and findings documents in the reports/ directory.
