Trials and tribulations of tackling Kaggle's RNA 3D Folding competition

##🧬 About the Project

As a research scientist who studied miRNA and RNA-binding protein regulation of CD36's 3' UTR, I fully understand the complexity of RNA regulation studies. Due to the complex structure of mRNA, it's difficult to predict the interaction of regulatory factors. Being able to contribute to RNA structural findings on the dry side of science in a way that can potentially benefit the work of others is a huge passion of mine. This project documents my journey through Kaggle’s RNA 3D Folding Prediction competition. I’ll be exploring different modeling approaches, tracking successes and failures, and implementing MLOps best practices to streamline my workflow.
